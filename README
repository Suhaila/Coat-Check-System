This is a university project that aims to speed up the process of checking in and retrieving a coat at a coat check service.

1. I've added 'Arduino_Controller' to... well... Control the Arduino board :)

So far running this script gets the first Arduino board to transmit a signal to the second Arduino board and turn on the LED.

2. I've renamed 'Main' to 'Write_to_CSV' (since we might not be using this anymore)

To run the 'Write_to_CSV' script:
- Open up a command prompt (cmd) 
- Navigate to the directory with the project by typing (replace the "..." with the rest of the path on your local machine):
	cd 'C:/users/.../Coat-Check-System/ 
- In the command prompt, type:
	python Main.py
- VOILA! It should work! (Verify this by opening Sample_data.csv and making sure that line 4 is added)

The UItest.py opens the UI and will write a hard coded variable to coats.csv. I still need to figure out how to get it to pull
information from the text entry field in Glade for the Check Coat side then how to search within the csv on the Retrieve side.
It shouldn't be too complicated but I haven't figured it out yet.
