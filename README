This is a university project that aims to speed up the process of checking in and retrieving a coat at a coat check service.

To run this script (so far):
- Open up a command prompt (cmd) 
- Navigate to the directory with the project by typing (replace the "..." with the rest of the path on your local machine):
	cd 'C:/users/.../Coat-Check-System/ 
- In the command prompt, type:
	python Main.py
- VOILA! It should work! (Verify this by opening Sample_data.csv and making sure that line 4 is added)
