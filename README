This is a university project that aims to speed up the process of checking in and retrieving a coat at a coat check service.

To run the 'CoatCheck.py' script:
- Open up a command prompt (cmd) 
- Navigate to the directory with the project by typing (replace the "..." with the rest of the path on your local machine):
	cd 'C:/.../Coat-Check-System/ 
- In the command prompt, type:
	python CoatCheck.py
- VOILA! It should bring up the UI!
